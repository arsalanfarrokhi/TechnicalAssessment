Frontend (React.js and Next.js):
React.js Basics:
Approach: Used state and props to manage dynamic elements like adding and displaying to-do items.
Key Considerations: Ensuring state updates correctly with user interaction and managing list re-rendering efficiently.
Challenges: Maintaining a clear separation of concerns between UI and state management.


Next.js Routing:

Approach: Utilized Next.js's built-in routing system to create multiple pages and enable smooth client-side navigation.
Key Considerations: Leveraging Next.jsâ€™s file-based routing and optimizing page loading performance.
Challenges: Handling dynamic routes and ensuring proper navigation without full page reloads.


API Integration:

Approach: Integrated a mock API using JSON Server and fetched data in Next.js to display it on the frontend.
Key Considerations: Using async/await for data fetching and handling loading states.
Challenges: Ensuring correct handling of asynchronous operations and rendering data efficiently.


Backend (Node.js):
Node.js Server:

Approach: Set up an Express.js server with a simple API endpoint returning JSON data.
Key Considerations: Defining API routes properly and structuring the server for future scalability.
Challenges: Managing correct routing and understanding the architecture of a Node.js server.


Middleware:

Approach: Created a middleware to log request details, aiding in debugging and monitoring.
Key Considerations: Ensuring middleware is non-intrusive and works efficiently across all routes.
Challenges: Implementing middleware without affecting server performance.


Database Interaction:

Approach: Connected Node.js with PostgreSQL, designed a user table, and implemented basic CRUD operations.
Key Considerations: Ensuring secure and efficient database access, and handling data validation.
Challenges: Writing SQL queries effectively and managing database connections.


Database (PostgreSQL):
Database Schema:

Approach: Designed a schema for a blogging platform, establishing relationships between users, posts, and comments.
Key Considerations: Defining proper foreign keys and normalization for efficient data storage.
Challenges: Balancing normalization and query performance.


SQL Queries:

Approach: Wrote queries to retrieve posts by users and count comments on posts, demonstrating database querying skills.
Key Considerations: Using JOINs and aggregation functions to fetch and manipulate data efficiently.
Challenges: Optimizing queries for performance as the dataset grows.
